# ArtToBookPages
This is a specific program to convert raw art into book pages with numbers.

This program takes in a ordered list of images and a blank aplha file.
It then proceded to paste the image onto the alpha alternating between offsets to make it look like a propper book and adds page numbers.
Once complete the images will be stored in a new directory so that there is no risk of loosing the existing work.
